LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, designed to address the vanishing gradient problem that often occurs in traditional RNNs. The vanishing gradient problem hampers the ability of RNNs to learn and retain long-term dependencies in sequential data.

LSTM networks introduce a memory cell that can maintain information over long periods of time, thus allowing the network to capture dependencies over many time steps. Each LSTM unit contains three gates: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. These gates control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell, enabling the network to selectively update its memory.

By selectively updating its memory cell through these gates, an LSTM network can effectively learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it particularly well-suited for tasks such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction.

Overall, LSTM networks offer a powerful solution for modeling sequential data by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and allowing networks to capture long-term dependencies.
